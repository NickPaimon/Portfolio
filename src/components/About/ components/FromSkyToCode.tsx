            At 31, my career has spanned from serving as a helicopter pilot in
            the military, including participation in the Anti-Terrorist
            Operation and a peacekeeping mission in DR Congo, to embracing the
            challenges of technology as a React JavaScript developer.

            This transition from aviation to coding was driven by a quest for
            new challenges and a passion for continuous learning. Within a year
            of self-directed study in JavaScript and React, I embarked on a new
            career path, quickly adapting to the dynamic world of tech.
